# learncplusplus

My NY resulution for 2015 was to learn c++ from the basis to write little applications. My aim is to write an application at the end of the year that can parse 3d models (e.g. obj) and apply some catmull clark subdivision to it. I'd then like to view the 3d model using open Gl. Hope this will turn out well. Until I am finally able to do something like this, I'll post my code experiments here, with the hope that somebody else can use it for their own projects. :D

1. First week of January: I bought myself a video training by Galileo Computing and a book. I learned about variables, functions etc.
2. Second week of January: I've installed an app on my tablet to practice the things I learn in my video course by answerting questions and watching youtube videos. Secondly I found the webpage cprogramming.com I've done their exercises on creating a pascal's triangle solver. See this link: http://www.cprogramming.com/challenge.html
3. February, March and April: I decided to stick with Sololearn and not only the video training by Galileo Press because I felt limited only using this. I've written some algorithms to calculate Pi. In a way I liked the MC method best, but I also tried around with Gauss and Leibnitz. For testing purpose also downloaded the BBP alogorithm. However I like the Monte Carlo method best, despite the fact that it's not very performing and accurate. For the next weeks I'd like to to do a bit more of the Monte Carlo stuff like calculating the value of risk. It will require reading .csv files, my video training will probably come in handy, but I'd like to try first. My brother has attended a c++ course by integrata. I'll check his excellent information. I hope they will supercharge me and boost my skills. :D My goal is still to create a simple raytracer, that's why I think that sticking with Monte Carlo in 2d and other fields can't be a bad idea.
