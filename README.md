# learncplusplus

My NY resulution for 2015 was to learn c++ from the basis to write little applications. My aim is to write an application at the end of the year that can parse 3d models (e.g. obj) and apply some catmull clark subdivision to it. I'd then like to view the 3d model using open Gl. Hope this will turn out well. Until I am finally able to do something like this, I'll post my code experiments here, with the hope that somebody else can use it for their own projects. :D
